IMPORTANT NOTES: 
 * Any post set as "Sticky" will be automatically added to the homepage slider.
 * The homepage slider is only activated if there is at least 2 featured/sticky posts.
 * For the slider featured image, the ideal width is at least 1000px and the ideal height is at least 300px. Any part of the featured image that exceeds this dimension will be automatically cropped.
 * The ideal size for the featured image on the homepage grid thumbnails is 300x300 pixels.
 * If there is no featured image set for a post, the first image found will be used instead. This works both for the slider and the grid thumbnails.
